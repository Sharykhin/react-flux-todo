#React TODO example

It is a simple implementation of TODO list by **React**.



##Dependencies

install mongodb: https://www.mongodb.org/

#### Getting started

To install dependencies and start compiling:

```
make install
make build
```

Then, in another tab run a local filesystem HTTP server:

```
make serve
```

You also have to run dpd server, open one more tab and run dpd:

```
make dpd
